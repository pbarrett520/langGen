# 🌍 LangForge Unified Demo

## Overview

The `demo_unified.py` script provides a comprehensive, interview-ready demonstration of LangForge's complete functionality. It showcases the entire pipeline from phonological generation to exportable vocabularies with beautiful formatting and professional presentation.

## Features Demonstrated

### 🔊 **Phase 1: Phonological Systems**
- Realistic phoneme inventories across 5 language families
- Weighted syllable structure generation
- Linguistic complexity analysis

### 🧱 **Phase 2: Morpheme Generation**
- Root and affix generation
- Language-specific morphological patterns
- Length and complexity analysis

### 📝 **Phase 3: Word Building & Vocabulary**
- Multiple word building strategies (simple, complex, mixed)
- Cross-family linguistic realism
- Complete Swadesh list generation (207 concepts)

### 💾 **Export & Integration**
- CSV export for spreadsheet analysis
- JSON export with complete metadata
- Auto-format detection
- Integration possibilities

### ⚙️ **Technical Showcase**
- Test-driven development metrics
- Linguistic realism measurements
- Software engineering best practices
